                    About me:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I always dreamed about being an astronaut as a child, flying through the
                    stars and adventuring the final frontier. Even with LEGOs, I have always looked to the Star Wars
                    sets, imagining what is out there. The glisten that was in my eyes, looked like the stars itself
                     full of curiosity and imagination of a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Then one day, my father brought home a broken computer (Would not turn
                    on). Me, full of precociousness, fiddled with the external wires. To my astonishment, I managed to
                    allow power to surge through the computer once again. This sparked (Get it?) my interest in the
                    technology field. Though, I did not know it this early. A nested interest in computers
                    planted its seed in my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Now, as a college student, with a love for making computers has turned
                    to the joys of software engineering. Coding through Collin Community College, The University of
                    Texas at Arlington and currently Southern Methodist University.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My specialties include quickly learning and applying recently new skills,
                    concepts or programming languages, web development, and responsive website design. So far, I have
                    Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git/Github, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Matlab under my belt with basic knowledge
                    in C++ and Java. While soon to be learning MySQL, NodeJS, React, Python, and C#. Also always looking
                    for new principles, programming languages, or any frameworks to apply to my future works.
